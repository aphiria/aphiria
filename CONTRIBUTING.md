# Contributing to Aphiria

We appreciate any and all contributions to Aphiria.  If you'd like to contribute, feel free to open up an issue, or raise a pull request on this repository (not the read-only Aphiria repositories).  To increase the odds that major new features in pull requests get merged, it's recommended to first open an issue so that the feature can be discussed prior to being implemented.

For more details on how to contribute, review the [contribution guide](https://www.aphiria.com/docs/0.x/contributing.html).
